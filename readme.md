<h3>ON JAVA : paste the world into C:\Users\"User"\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\saves and your good to go!</h3>
   
<h3> ON BEDROCK : You need to use a 3rd party server to join as this is a java world - Visit https://aternos.org and create a JAVA server using PaperMC or Spigot as the software. Install the plugin named GeyserMC to allow bedrock players to join the server. Go to the Worlds and import the world into Aternos. To join the server on Xbox, PlayStation, or Switch download an app named Bedrock Together/Bedrock Together. Make sure that your console and phone are connected to the same network. Enter your server IP and Port, and start your server. When your server is started  start the app and join.
